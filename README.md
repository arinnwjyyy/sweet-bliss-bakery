#**Sweet Bliss Bakery Website**
---
Welcome to the Sweet Bliss Bakery project! This is a cozy, heartwarming website for a fictional bakery that aims to bring warmth, sweetness, and a sense of community to its visitors. Whether you're craving a flaky croissant, a rich cup of artisan coffee, or just a welcoming spot to make memories, this site is designed to feel like a warm hug from your favorite bakery. Below, I'll walk you through what this project is about, how to set it up, and the thought process behind itâ€”because every line of code here was crafted with love!
