#Sweet Bliss Bakery Website

Welcome to the Sweet Bliss Bakery project! This is a cozy, heartwarming website for a fictional bakery that aims to bring warmth, sweetness, and a sense of community to its visitors. Whether you're craving a flaky croissant, a rich cup of artisan coffee, or just a welcoming spot to make memories, this site is designed to feel like a warm hug from your favorite bakery. Below,  I'll walk you through what this project is about, how to set it up, and the thought process behind it—because every line of code here was crafted with love!

##Project Overview
---
The Sweet Bliss Bakery website is a responsive, user-friendly single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript. It’s designed to capture the essence of a cozy bakery with a soft, pastel aesthetic and intuitive navigation. The goal was to create a digital space that feels as inviting as walking into a bakery filled with the aroma of freshly baked goods.
