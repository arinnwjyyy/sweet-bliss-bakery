# Sweet Bliss Bakery Website
Welcome to the Sweet Bliss Bakery project! This is a cozy, heartwarming website for a fictional bakery that aims to bring warmth, sweetness, and a sense of community to its visitors. Whether you're craving a flaky croissant, a rich cup of artisan coffee, or just a welcoming spot to make memories, this site is designed to feel like a warm hug from your favorite bakery. Below,  I'll walk you through what this project is about, how to set it up, and the thought process behind it—because every line of code here was crafted with love!

## Project Overview
The Sweet Bliss Bakery website is a responsive, user-friendly single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript. It’s designed to capture the essence of a cozy bakery with a soft, pastel aesthetic and intuitive navigation. The goal was to create a digital space that feels as inviting as walking into a bakery filled with the aroma of freshly baked goods.

### Features
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, with a mobile-friendly hamburger menu for smaller screens.
- **Interactive Navigation**: A fixed navbar with smooth hover effects and a toggleable menu for mobile users.
- **Hero Section**: A welcoming, full-screen hero with a background image and a call-to-action (CTA) button to draw visitors in.
- **About Section**: Highlights the bakery’s story with hoverable image boxes that reveal charming descriptions.
- **Menu Section**: Showcases delightful treats with images and a CTA to explore the full menu.
- **Subscription Form**: A simple form for visitors to join the bakery’s community, styled with a soft, semi-transparent background.
- **Footer**: Includes social media icons and contact info, keeping the cozy vibe consistent.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: For semantic, accessible structure.
- CSS3: For styling, with custom fonts (Lora and Nanum Pen Script) and media queries for responsiveness.
- JavaScript: For the mobile menu toggle functionality.
- Fonts: Google Fonts (Lora for body text, Nanum Pen Script for headings) to evoke warmth and personality.
- Images: Placeholder images for the hero, about, and menu sections (replace with real bakery images for production).
